data: 
  description:    zeros(N) is an N-by-N matrix of zeros.
                  zeros(M,N) or zeros([M,N]) is an M-by-N matrix of zeros.
                  zeros(M,N,P,...) or zeros([M N P ...]) is an M-by-N-by-P-by-... array of
                  zeros.
                  zeros(SIZE(A)) is the same size as A and all zeros.
                  zeros with no arguments is the scalar 0.
                  zeros(..., CLASSNAME) is an array of zeros of class specified by the
                  string CLASSNAME.
                  zeros(..., 'like', Y) is an array of zeros with the same data type, sparsity,
                  and complexity (real or complex) as the numeric variable Y.
